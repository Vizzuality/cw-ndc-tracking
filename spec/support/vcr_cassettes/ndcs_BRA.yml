        GDP increased by 32%, while emissions dropped 52% (GWP-100; IPCC AR5), delinking
        economic growth from emission increase over the period, while at the same
        time Brazil lifted more than 23 million people out of poverty.\u003c/p\u003e

        equivalent to what some developed countries have considered fair and ambitious
        for their average per capita emissions by 2030. Brazil''s per capita emissions

        successful biofuel programs to date, including cogeneration of electricity
        using biomass. Brazil has achieved the most impressive results of any country
        in reducing emissions from deforestation, mainly by reducing the deforestation
        rate in the Brazilian Amazonia by 82% between 2004 and 2014. Brazil''s energy
        mix today consists of 40% of renewables (75% of renewables in its electricity
        supply), which amounts to three times the world average in renewables, and
        more than four times the OECD average. This already qualifies Brazil as a

        and Equity\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"Most of the current concentration
        of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a result of emissions since the industrial
        revolution (the post-1750 period). Current generations are bearing the costs
        of past interference with the global climate system, resulting from human
        activities and consequent greenhouse gas emissions, primarily by developed
        countries, during the last two centuries. Similarly, current human activities
        around the world will affect the climate system over the next centuries.\u003c/p\u003e
        \u003cp\u003eIn order to build a fair and equitable global response to climate
        change, it is therefore of central importance to link cause (net anthropogenic
        greenhouse gas emissions) and effect (temperature increase and global climate
        change).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe global mean surface temperature increase
        due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is an objective criterion to
        measure climate change, serving the purpose of establishing upper limits to
        prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u003c/p\u003e
        \u003cp\u003eThe specific and relative role of each actor''s emissions to
        global climate change can be determined using the global mean surface temperature
        as an indicator. Each individual actor''s contribution to temperature increase
        should take into consideration differences in terms of starting points, approaches,
        economic structures, resource bases, the need to maintain sustainable economic
        growth, available technologies and other individual circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e
        \u003cp\u003eEstablishing the series, in all sectors, of anthropogenic greenhouse
        gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks allows the estimation of the
        relative share of total temperature increase attributable to an individual
        country. The relative responsibility of a given country in relation to the
        global mean surface temperature increase can be estimated with a high level
        of confidence. Hence, the marginal relative contribution to the global average
        surface temperature increase is a relevant measure to evaluate responsibility
        in the global effort to limit temperature increase to 2\u0026deg;C compared
        to preindustrial levels.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBrazil''s mitigation efforts

        countries most responsible for climate change. In view of the above, and based
        on available tools, it is evident that Brazil''s iNDC, while consistent with
        its national circumstances and capabilities, is far more ambitious than what
